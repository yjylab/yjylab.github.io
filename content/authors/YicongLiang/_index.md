Yicong（梁艺聪）joined the Yu lab in August 2024. He earned his Ph.D. from the Institute of Medical Microbiology, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University in 2023. His previous research investigated the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the infection, replication, and transmission of Enterovirus 71 (EV71). His current research primarily focuses on optimizing EVs-based vaccine delivery platforms and exploring the underlying mechanisms.
