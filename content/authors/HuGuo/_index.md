Pinocytosis, especially macropinocytosis, is a special endocytosis pathway for cells to uptake nutrients and other liquid phase macromolecules, involved in many important biological processes such as pathogen invasion. We are trying to understand the molecular mechanism of adenovirus and coronavirus invasion of host cells, which may provide a theoretical basis for the design and screening of antiviral drugs and adenovirus vaccine adjuvants.
