Jingyou (Jay) Yu, Ph.D., is a Principal Investigator at Guangzhou National Laboratory (GZNL) and Adjunct Professor at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. Dr. Yu received his Ph.D. with Shan-Lu Liu from The Ohio State University and his postdoctoral training with Dan Barouch from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center-Harvard Medical School. His research focuses on the mechanisms of immune defense against viruses at the mucosal surfaces, and the development of mucosal vaccine strategies. He is also devoting efforts to optimizing current vaccine platforms, e.g. adenoviral vectored and mRNA vaccines, for more secure, effective, and affordable utilizations. Dr. Yu, meanwhile, leads multiple other studies to explore the mechanistic insights into improved immunogenicity through a few novel vaccine modalities and some immunization combinations. 

Dr. Yu received several awards, including the American Society of Virology Travel Award, the OSU Distinguished Research Award, the Harvard Chinese Life Science Annual Distinguished Research Award, and the CROI New Investigator Scholarship. His current work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Overseas High-level Talents program, and the major projects of the GZNL.
